Here are a few weird things that I read this year that I really liked. It's a list offered in a spirit of exploration: I have no idea if you will also like them, but they'll probably at least fall well outside of your normal distribution. 

# [Woodworking](ttps://www.amazon.com/Woodworking-Emily-St-James/dp/163893147X)

#### Emily St. James, 2025

A straightforward transfeminine bildungsroman in most ways, but a brilliant book any way you cut it. Set in a very accurately described small conservative town, it follows a thirtysomething woman who just realized she's trans and forms a fraught friendship with the first trans woman she meets: a seventeen year old trans girl in her class. You can sort of feel the places where this book is shaped by the current political hostility but then again so are all of us.
# [The Proud Tower: A Portrait of the World Before the War, 1890-1914](https://www.amazon.com/Proud-Tower-Portrait-Before-1890-1914/dp/0345405013)

#### Barbara Tuchman, 1966

A work of history that is equally detailed and spellbinding, it describes the conditions, personalities, and above all the vibes of the turn of the last century. If you have a vague but persistent sense that we're collectively headed towards a disaster all can see but none can avert, you should read this, if only to understand that we've been here before.

# [Translation State](https://www.amazon.com/Translation-State-Ann-Leckie-ebook/dp/B0BH4JGLMC?crid=3TGEYHO1PUOR2)

#### Ann Leckie, 2023

A book about alien puberty, and about discovering you're completely different from everyone around you and deciding they're still your family. For some reason I found this relatiable This is technically set in the same world as a bunch of Ann Leckie's other books. If you want the full picture, start with (the utterly brilliant) [Ancillary Justice](https://www.amazon.com/Ancillary-Justice-Imperial-Radch-Leckie/dp/031624662X) but this book will stand on its own, I believe.

# 📺 Murderbot

#### Apple TV, 2025

Based on the first of [an amazing series of novellas](https://www.amazon.com/The-Murderbot-Diaries-8-book-series/dp/B07FK8SNWY) by Martha Wells, I was amazed to find that a story that takes place almost entirely in the internal narrative of a bored, sarcastic, and socially anxious ~~murderbot~~ "security unit" could be turned into a really good tv show. I really recommend this, and if anyone wants to watch it I'll put it back on my plex for you. 

# [I sexually identify as an attack helicopter](https://isabelfall.neocities.org/Isabel_Fall_-_I_Sexually_Identify_as_an_Attack_Helicopter.pdf)

#### Isabel Fall, 2020

This Is not new to me, but I read it with a new understanding this year. It is both a tense little science fiction story (Scifi is at its best at short story length, imo) a clinical but deeply felt consideration of gender and sexuality under military-industrialism, and a fascinating near future world. Isabel Fall [died to bring this to us,](https://web.archive.org/web/20210701185942/https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter) and it deserves to be known.

# [WARHOUND](https://archiveofourown.org/works/48577036)

#### KallidoraRho, 2023

Another thing that it is, almost inevitably given The Way We Are, is the author's thinly disguised fetish. WARHOUND is an author's undisguised fetish. This is what's known as "mechsploitation," at this point a thriving micro-genre about expendability, dominance, submission, and complicity in military atrocity. There are [endless](https://x.com/nyetalia/status/1681877912717328385) [examples](https://x.com/nyetalia/status/1684640479072096257?s=20) [at tweet length](https://princess.team/tags/seriesflight-deck/) and [longer. ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IjqRKJth-Rb9RQtkgXStA233nwkbMJ4AyDcRugysRr0/edit?tab=t.0) 
# [A Gun That Makes People Stop Being Transphobic](https://halimedemf.substack.com/p/a-gun-that-makes-people-stop-being)

#### Halimede, 2025

"Isn't that just a regular gun?" Yes but this story, by Twitter-personality-whose-bit-is-too-complicated-for-me-to-explain-here Halimede is a quick and enjoyable discourse on what women share.
